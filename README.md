    # Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project uses a simple Naive Bayes classifier to classify news headlines as **Real** or **Fake**.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn`
2. Run the script: `python fake_news_detection.py`

## Example Prediction
Input: `"Aliens have landed on Earth"`  
Output: **Fake**
